# Hi 👋

I'm a software engineer focused on backend systems, developer tooling, and the "trendy" AI.

## Featured projects
- [hackMatch.ai](https://github.com/the-sam-mit/hackMatch.ai)
  - Full-stack hackathon idea generator powered by Google Gemini (FastAPI + Next.js). Good for quickly generating and iterating on hackathon concepts and demos.
  - _**Fun Fact**_: Fully vibe-coded (thanks to Antigravity!💙)
  
- [trendyAI](https://github.com/the-sam-mit/trendyAI)
  - An AI Content Manager that helps budding creators optimize their social media presence using RAG.
  - _**Fun Fact**_: One of the first projects under AI learning series (Coming soon!!😛)

If this looks good, I can:
- Commit this README to the repository named `the-sam-mit` on GitHub (please confirm), or
- Update the TrendyAI description right away if you provide the exact repo URL or preferred one-line text.
